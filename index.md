# Enhanced Multi-Server MCP Index

This directory contains an enhanced multi-server MCP example that demonstrates the integration of multiple capabilities:

## Available Resources

### Weather Server Resources
- **Delivery Log**: Contains order delivery information across various cities
- **Index**: This documentation file

### Task Server Resources  
- **Meeting Notes**: Ed Tech company meeting notes with action items and discussion points

## Order Processing Information

Recent delivery data shows successful completions across major metropolitan areas:
- East Coast: New York, Boston, Miami
- West Coast: Los Angeles, Seattle, Portland  
- Central: Chicago, Denver, Austin, Phoenix

Weather patterns in these delivery locations can be analyzed to optimize delivery schedules and routes.

## Meeting Action Items Tracking

The meeting notes contain several action items with deadlines:
- Technical improvements (database optimization, wireframes, analytics)
- Business development (partnerships, marketing campaigns)
- Strategic planning (roadmap prioritization)

These items can be automatically extracted and converted to task list items for better project management.
